Creating and using an ssh key to push to GitHub.

if you have already cloned the repo, start at step 2:

if you have not cloned the repo as of yet, start at step 1:  
1. git clone 'paste repository ssh link here'
2. cd into directory cloned
3. git init
4. create user:
git config --global user.name "your name here"
git config --global user.email "your email here"
5. create link using: "git remote add 'alias you choose' 'ssh link for repository'
6. git pull "alias you chose" master
7. create file you want
8. git add .
9. git commit -m "commit message"
10. ls ~/.ssh
11. if you already have an existing key called "id_rsa.pub", then cat the file using "cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
12. if you do not have the key then run this command "ssh-keygen", then "cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
13. copy entire key
14. go to GitHub account and go to settings
15. select SSH GPG keys
16. select new SSH key
17. choose key name and then paste key below
18. select add SSH Key
19. go back to command line and "git push 'alias you chose' master" (you can run "git remote -v" to see alias you chose if needed)
20. go to GitHub to confirm your file has been pushed
21. you did it!
22. let me know if you have questions.
